# RSVP-Movies-Case-Study
The SQL - RSVP Movies Case Study is an analysis of an IMDb dataset aimed at drawing insights and making recommendations for a future movie project. The dataset used in this study consists of information on movies, including their titles, release dates, ratings, and production budgets.

The analysis begins with data cleaning, which involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and checking for data inconsistencies. The data is then explored using SQL queries to identify trends and patterns in the data.
The main findings of the analysis are as follows: movies that are released during the summer months tend to have higher box office revenues than movies released during other times of the year. Additionally, movies that have high ratings and low production budgets tend to have higher returns on investment.
Based on these findings, recommendations are made for a future movie project. These recommendations include releasing the movie during the summer months, focusing on creating high-quality content to increase ratings, and keeping the production budget low to maximize the return on investment.
Overall, the SQL - RSVP Movies Case Study demonstrates the importance of using data analysis to make informed decisions in the movie industry. By analyzing trends and patterns in the data, it is possible to identify strategies that can lead to more successful movies in the future.
