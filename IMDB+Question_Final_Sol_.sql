Now, wouldn’t you want to know which genre had the highest number of movies produced in the last year?
Combining both the movie and genres table can give more interesting insights. */

-- Q6.Which genre had the highest number of movies produced overall?
-- Type your code below:

-- Q7. How many movies belong to only one genre?
-- Type your code below:
